# Simple-kids-game
could anyone help on how to simplyfy this code 
there started out with a basic 4 lines to get what i wanted 
then wanted to make it more of a game rather than just code running
in the command prompt

this is a very simple Kids batman game my first attempt at coding
and ive been learning python for about 3 weeks 
I belive it was a challenge on another app
